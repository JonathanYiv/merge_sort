# Merge Sort Project

This is my version of implementing the [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) in ruby.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion).

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```

$ cd merge_sort
$ ruby merge_sort.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

No particular thoughts.

## Post-Project Thoughts

Implementing was about light to moderate difficulty.
